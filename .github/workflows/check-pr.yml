              **Policy**: Only version branches (matching pattern \`v*.*.*\`) can be merged into \`main\`.

              **Current source branch**: \`${sourceBranch}\`

              **To fix this**:
              - Merge your changes into the \`dev\` branch instead
              - Or create a version branch (e.g., \`v1.0.0\`) if you're ready for a release

              For more information, see the project's branching strategy.`
